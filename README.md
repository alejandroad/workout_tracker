Welcome to workout_tracker. The goal of this applicaiton is to provide an interface where you can log lifts, and based on a certain program, it will auto recomend you workouts with 'progressive overload' in mind. This way,
you don't have to do much thinking other than actually remembering to log your workouts. Additionally, there are plans to include data visulization to see your performance improvements over time. Initially, we will just
be tracking the S / B / D, but there are plans for further integrations.
